## CSS and Design üÜò

Recently, I began working through Josh Comeau's brilliant CSS course -
["CSS for JavaScript Developers"](https://css-for-js.dev/).

I am learning things about CSS from the course that I have barely understood in the past - or have
never really understood at all.

Going through the lessons slowly has given me an appreciation of how much there is to know about
styling content for a browser.

I knew it was difficult, of course. I have been struggling through CSS, with mixed results, since I
first began to learn to code four years ago. Not terrible CSS, but not particularly great, either.

**CSS for JavaScript Developers** is jam packed with information. Each module of the course has made
clear **several things** that I have mentally skimmed over many times - all the while hoping for the
best as I skimmed.

Of course, I am in the process of applying what I am learning to my own work - and that means
practice. Now, and in future projects. I still have a long way to go to fully absorb and make my own
what Comeau is teaching - but I feel like I am on a better, more solid path - with much more idea of
how the pieces fit together.

I first came across the work of Josh Comeau this past summer. Not only is he a very good developer -
but he is also a darn good designer - albeit not a full time designer.

Somehow he has acquired design skills over time.

And I aspire to that

The more I learn about CSS - the more closely I look at the visual details of the components I am
creating with my code - and the more I separate it from design.

CSS and design are two very different animals. The former is producing code for ( using any one of a
huge number of CSS solutions ) existing ideas for the visuals of an app and/or website.

The latter is coming up with those ideas to begin with.

_If either one of those animals is on shaky ground . . ._

The only solution I can think of is the only one that I **can** implement:

_Do the best that I can to develop design intuition and keep growing with it each day._

If I want to continue working on unpaid personal projects ( **which I do** ) then I am looking at
**two** marathons in acquiring and growing these skills. Not one marathon.

## Starving Solo Artistry ü•´ üé®

Over the four year period since I wrote my first line of code - mostly self learning - along with a
12 week bootcamp last year - I have gotten pretty good at HTML, CSS, JavaScript - and the React
library, plus it's related frameworks.

I have narrowed my focus to the frontend - and while I consider myself far from expert - I have
acquired confidence in my skills.

Designing my personal projects is very difficult.

Unlike working on a team at most companies, when I am working on my own there is no help in sight.
It is pretty much up to me. Sure, I could ask some friends to help me with design - but I would not
learn or grow much that way.

I would rather develop my own instincts and intuition. So, I struggle through it.

I am not particularly interested in cloning other apps or websites. Sometimes, I do a limited number
of tutorials from effective online educators - but for the most part, I want to implent my own ideas
when I spend time coding - for several reasons.

For one thing, any work that I generate I want to be able to use myself in a practical way.
Secondly, I want to be able to show the work to potential employers. And the idea of showing an
Instagram clone does not sound good to me. It would indeed be a worthwhile learning exercise - but I
want something more than that from the projects that I work on.

## No Designers Around üò≠

I am realizing that I just simply have to embrace it. Try as much as I can to develop my tastes and
instincts for what works well visually.

I have always considered the web a visual medium. It is closer to cinema, in it's use of various
media, than it is to writing on paper.

Yet pieces of software are tools, right? It is about what the software can _do_ and the problems it
solves.

It is a paradox, it seems.

Beyond being inspired by Comeau's CSS course - doing more and more of my own work has made me think
about these issues for lately.

Beautiful things are mesmerizing. We are attracted to anything that looks good. From other humans,
to buildings. It is just the way we are wired as humans.

Software is no exception.

## On my own? üò®

Solo devs are like filmmakers who have no resources to hire a cinematographer and so they must learn
photograpy, composition, lenses, depth of field, lighting.

And we are not even talking about distribution yet - or anyone seeing the film.

Not only must I have the technical skills to implement my ideas ( CSS coding skills - e.g., flexbox,
positional layout tools, grid, styling solutions like Emotion or CSS Modules, etc ) but I also must
have the design skills to come up with something interesting.

These are conflicts in the brain. All kinds of programming logic in building a UI with React, plus
things like deployment skills, churning out ideas for an interesting app, and making it look
engaging and professional - technically and conceptually.

I do not subscribe to the left brain / right brain myth. I believe that I can get better at design
if I work at it - like anything. But, geez, it is not easy . . .

Luckily, there is help if I look around enough. Josh's [course](https://css-for-js.dev/) is one
source that I have already mentioned.

There is the help and inspiration that comes from viewing interesting and beautiful websites and web
apps from various companies and individuals around the world.

I have also gotten ideas from work that I have found on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) - some of it
so ingenious and beautiful that is rises to the level of digital fine art. And the source code can
be looked at and studied **for free**.

It is a process.

As [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/) has written about in a terrific blog
[post](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/solidifying-what-you-learn) of his:

**Consume, build, teach**.

There are mentors all over the world who I may never meet in person. They have taught me either
directly through their educational materials like Josh Comeau and Kent C. Dodds have - or simply
through the example of their work such as when I come across a website or app that is particularly
beautiful to me.

So, there might not be a design calvary on the way for my personal projects. But help is here. Not
on the way. **But already here**. Out on the world wide web.

I only have to look for it to see it ‚úÖ
