# **Comfortable Feeling Dumb**

This is using TypeScript, Next.js, MDX and TailwindCSS.

My main programming blog, I am recommiting in May 2024 to putting out atleast two blog posts a month.

This blog uses the latest in Next.js and MDX and TailwindCSSv4.

Most of my posts will be around the three main programming languages that I commited to in my work.

I will add more and more functionality over time as I write more content.
