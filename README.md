# **Comfortable Feeling Dumb**

This blog uses the latest in Next.js and MDX and TailwindCSSv4.

Most of my posts will be around things like the main programming languages that I commited to in my work, the various web frameworks that I love, and Agentic Engineering with tools like [ampcode](https://ampcode.com/), [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs), and [Zed](https://zed.dev).

I am also a trail runner and I love writing about that, too 🏃 😍
